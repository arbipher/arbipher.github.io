Rules for Operational Semantics Rules

**Automata** is a device to decide whether a string is in a language. Automata can be finite or infinite, can be deterministic and non-deterministic.

**Operational Semantics** can be **small-step semantics** (structural operational semantics or reduction semantics) or **big-step semantics** (natural semantics)

**Evaluation strategy** is a preference of rules

What is **grammar rewrite** (for CFG) in **opsem**?



**Rewrite system**
**Deductive system**

As a mathematical object, an unlabeled transition system is identical with an (unindexed) abstract rewriting system.
