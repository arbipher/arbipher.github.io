## # Shiwei Weng 翁士伟

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My advisor is [Dr. Scott Smith](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/) and I am a member of [The Programming Languages Laboratory](http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/). I got my joint bachelor's degree from Fudan University and University College Dublin in 2013 and master degree from JHU in 2018. My one-page CV is [here](/assets/pdf/CV_shiwei_weng_JHU_year4_PhD.pdf) (updated Aug 2021).

My research interests span several aspects of programming languages. I believe programming languages can provide solutions to problems in other areas of computer science. I am active in our lab's weekly [seminar](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/seminars/fall-2020/) and happy to [chat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %}) about them.



<!-- ~~**I am looking forward to summer internship 2020 (functional languages esp. OCaml preferred but all is fine). <a href="mailto:wengshiwei@jhu.edu">Email me</a> wengshiwei@jhu.edu**~~ -->

## # Research

### Demand-Driven Symbolic Execution  [[lab page](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/projects/demand-driven-symbolic-execution/)]

- Symbolic _backwards_ execution of functional languages
- Start from any position in programs
- (Done) Establish the soundness and develop a test generation algorithm. See publication [ICFP 2020].
- (In progress) Optimization (function summarization), new features (mutable states), new approaches (model checking)  [[repo](https://github.com/JHU-PL-Lab/ddse)]

<!-- ### 2. Program Analysis on the Usage of JavaScript GUI Frameworks

- Treat JavaScript with framework APIs e.g. ReactJS as a new OO/Functional DSL
- Run program analysis to check the usage of framework APIs -->
<!-- - Inspired by [flapjax](https://www.flapjax-lang.org/) -->

## # Work Experience

### Microsoft Research Lab, Redmond (_virtually_), Summer 2021, 

I worked as a Research Intern on [Checked C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/checked-c/) project. I designed and implemented a dataflow analysis which gathers pre/post-conditions at program points and an SMT-­based proof framework to reduce false-positive compiler warnings. It's a wonderful summer. Thanks to my mentor Sulekha Kulkarni, the boss David Tarditi and all the team members!

### Something before

I got an internship offer from [Nomadic Labs](https://nomadic-labs.com/) on Linear Types and OCaml program analysis for summer 2019. However, due to the COVID-19 and regulations for international students in United States, I cannot make it physically nor virtually. What a pity.

Before graduate school, I took several jobs in start-ups and freelance work, mostly in full-stack web programming.

## # Open Source

I [maintain](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/z3/) z3-ocaml after fixing a notorious bug lasting for years ([explanation](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/my-fix-of-the-linking-problem-on-z3-ocaml-binding/8691) on OCaml Discuss). Other randoms.

## # Misc

I [play](https://steamcommunity.com/id/arbipher/games/?tab=all&sort=playtime) video games. The unexamined game is not worth playing.

I am married to [Xiaoxi Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%B0%8F%E6%BA%AA-%E9%99%88-6655b489/) 陈小溪. I teach her programming and she teaches me human anatomy.

We have a <a href="/assets/img/cat_2019.jpg" target="_blank">cat</a> but there is usually more at home (<a href="/assets/img/2_cats_2020.mp4" target="_blank">2 cats</a>, <a href="/assets/img/3_cats_2021.jpg" target="_blank">3 cats</a>).
