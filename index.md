  <p class='profile-item-inner' markdown='1'>

I am a six-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My advisor is [Dr. Scott Smith](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/) and I am a member of [The Programming Languages Laboratory](http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/). I got my joint bachelor's degree from Fudan University and University College Dublin in 2013 and master's degree from JHU in 2018. My one-page CV is [here](/assets/pdf/CV_shiwei_weng_JHU_year5_PhD_summer_internship.pdf) (updated Mar 2023).

  <p class='profile-item-inner' markdown='1'>

My research interests span several aspects of programming languages. I believe programming languages can provide solutions to problems in other areas of computer science. I am active in our lab's weekly [seminar](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/seminars/fall-2020/) and happy to [chat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %}) about them.

## # Research

### Package Managers à la Carte [[slide@NJPLS'25](_slide/NJPLS'25-pkgm/pkgm.html)]

- Mmodel package managers as _distributed key-value stores_ equipped with _version logics_.
- Introduce a proof-of-concept framework that enables the modular derivation of package managers with desired feature.
- More to be released soon.

### Semantic-Type-Guided Type Checker [[lab page](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/projects/semantic-type-checker/)]

- Kelvin Qian, Scott Smith, Brandon Stride, Shiwei Weng, Ke Wu, OOPSLA 2024 [[page](https://2024.splashcon.org/details/splash-2024-oopsla/131/Semantic-Type-Guided-Bug-Finding)] [[doi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689788)] [[pdf](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3689788)] [[repo](https://github.com/JHU-PL-Lab/jaylang)]
- _Semantic_ typing rather than static typing.
- Focus is on finding incorrect typings, only a single counterexample is needed.
- Have An initial implementation to efficiently find type errors over a functional language with a rich type system

### Higher-Order Demand-Driven Symbolic Execution [[lab page](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/projects/demand-driven-symbolic-execution/)]

- Zachary Palmer, Theodore Park, Scott Smith, Shiwei Weng, Higher-Order Demand-Driven Symbolic Evaluation, ICFP 2020 [[page](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/icfp-2020-papers/22/Higher-Order-Demand-Driven-Symbolic-Evaluation)] [[doi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408984)] [[pdf](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/projects/demand-driven-symbolic-execution/papers/icfp20-ddse-full.pdf)] [[repo](https://github.com/JHU-PL-Lab/odefa)] [[talk@UMD](https://talks.cs.umd.edu/talks/2657) ([slide](assets/pdf/2020-ddse-umd.pdf))] [[talk@NJPLS'22]((https://njpls.org/oct22.html))]
- Symbolic _backwards_ execution of functional languages.
- Start from any position in programs.
- Establish the soundness and develop a test generation algorithm.

<!-- - Bounded Model Checking [[repo](https://github.com/JHU-PL-Lab/ddse)] -->

<!-- [[NJPLS 2022](https://njpls.org/oct22.html)] -->
<!-- - Give a talk at  ([[pic](https://twitter.com/LeoLambro/status/1583522021811490817)]) for progress on the BMC. -->

## # Work

### Microsoft Research Lab, Redmond (_virtually_), Summer 2021

I worked as a Research Intern on [Checked C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/checked-c/) project. I designed and implemented a dataflow analysis which gathers pre/post-conditions at program points and an SMT-­based proof framework to reduce false-positive compiler warnings. It's a wonderful summer. Thanks to my mentor Sulekha Kulkarni, the boss David Tarditi and all the team members!

### Something before

<!-- I got an internship offer from [Nomadic Labs](https://nomadic-labs.com/) on Linear Types and OCaml program analysis for summer 2019. However, due to the COVID-19 and regulations for international students in United States, I cannot make it physically nor virtually. What a pity. -->

Before graduate school, I took several jobs in start-ups and freelance work, mostly in full-stack web programming.
