## Shiwei Weng 翁士伟

**I am looking forward to summer internship 2020 (functional languages esp. OCaml preferred but all is fine). <a href="mailto:wengshiwei@jhu.edu">Email me</a> wengshiwei@jhu.edu**

I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My advisor is [Dr. Scott Smith](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/) and I am a member of [The Programming Languages Laboratory](http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/). I got my joint bachelor degree from Fudan University and University College Dublin in 2013 and master degree from JHU in 2018. My one-page CV is [here](/assets/pdf/CV_shiwei_weng_JHU_year2_PhD_summer_internship.pdf) (updated Nov 2019).

My research interests span several aspects in programming languages. I believe programming languages can provide solid solutions to problems in other areas in computer science. I am fascinated in theoretical problems which also have real-world impact.

## Research

### 1. Demand-Driven Symbolic Execution [[repo]](//github.com/JHU-PL-Lab/odefa/tree/test-generation) [[page]](//pl.cs.jhu.edu/projects/demand-driven-program-analysis/) [[preprint]](//pl.cs.jhu.edu/projects/demand-driven-program-analysis/papers/higher-order-demand-driven-symbolic-execution-preprint.pdf)

- Symbolic _backwards_ execution of functional languages
- Start from any position in programs
- Establish the soundness and define a test generation algorithm

### 2. Program Analysis on the Usage of JavaScript GUI Frameworks

- Treat JavaScript with framework APIs e.g. ReactJS as a new OO/Functional DSL
- Run program analysis to check the usage of framework APIs
<!-- - Inspired by [flapjax](https://www.flapjax-lang.org/) -->

## Professional Experience

- Head Teaching Assistant, [601.426/626 Principles of Programming Languages](//pl.cs.jhu.edu/pl/index.shtml), Spring 18 (evaluation [1](/assets/pdf/EN.601.426.01.SP18PrinciplesofProgrammingLanguages_ScottSmith.pdf) [2](/assets/pdf/EN.601.626.01.SP18PrinciplesofProgrammingLanguages_ScottSmith.pdf)), Spring 19 ([evaluation](/assets/pdf/EN.601.426.01.SP19PrinciplesofProgrammingLanguages_ScottSmith.pdf))

## Work Experience

I am the system administrator of [our lab](http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/).

In my gap years before the grad school, I took several some start-ups and freelance work, mostly in full-stack web programming.

## Misc

[Blogs](/blog) ([博客](/blog_cn)) are under construction.

I [play](https://steamcommunity.com/id/arbipher/games/?tab=all&sort=playtime) video games. The unexamined game is not worth playing.

I am married to [Xiaoxi Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%B0%8F%E6%BA%AA-%E9%99%88-6655b489/) 陈小溪. I teach her programming and she teaches me human anatomy.
