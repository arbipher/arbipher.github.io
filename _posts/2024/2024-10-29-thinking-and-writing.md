I recently read [Writes and Write-Nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html?continueFlag=c8864713145c1506ceee3a6f7e7808c3) by Paul Graham, in which he emphasizes the significant of writing:

> The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking. In fact there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. You can't make this point better than **Leslie Lamport** did:
>
> If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking.

I like the sentence, but I wish to check Lamport really said that. By some searching, I can confirm it. It's from his TLA+ [slide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/leslie_lamport.pdf) in 2016, in which he said (How to Think):

> “Writing is nature’s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is.” Guindon
> 
> To think, you have to write.
> 
> If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.
