`time` is a common shell utility to measure the elapsed time. I occasionally found someone use `/usr/bin/time` instead of `time` and sometimes `/usr/bin/time` doesn't exist. I search for this topic a bit and think it's subtler that I initially expected.

```shell
$ type -a time
type -a time
time is a shell keyword
time is /usr/bin/time

$ time --version
time --version
bash: --version: command not found

$ time --version
zsh: command not found: --version
--version  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 0.019 total

$ /usr/bin/time --version
GNU time 1.7
```

I run this on my ubuntu in wsl and a server running debian. However, for a fresh image, GNU time may be not installed yet.

```shell
$ type -a time
time is a shell keyword

$ /usr/bin/time
-bash: /usr/bin/time: No such file or directory
```

Therefore, the quick answer to the question in the title is

1. `time` is a shell command
2. `time` at `/usr/bin/time` is `GNU time`

It's better we just use one of them in one shell script. This [answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27920/why-bash-time-is-more-precise-then-gnu-time/27934#27934?newreg=34f16c0ea88f438a9fe843b9ae1e2406) says bash `time` is more precise than GNU `time` since `getusage()` has better microsecond resolution than `times()` in each code.

p.s.1
Technically, bash `time` is a command/keyword but not a builtin, though people tend to call it a shell builtin.

```shell
$ builtin time
builtin time
bash: builtin: time: not a shell builtin
$ builtin cd
builtin cd
```

p.s.2
`bash` is indeed *GNU bash*.
