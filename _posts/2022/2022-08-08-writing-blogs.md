I used to keep a daily-to-weekly blog in high school and lower undergrad time. The primary motivation is self-discussion. After that period in life, I solved (or was no longer interested in) many questions) so I turned silent. Now I am a later-stage Ph.D. student. I usually have informal writings on daily thoughts. I have been collecting enough **motivations**, to put these in a blog.

Matt Might's [_6 blog tips for busy academics_][6tips] is an excellent argument and guide. If you declare no time for blogging while you do any of these things, write a post instead:

- give lectures
- "reply to public"
- give advice
- vent steam

He gives do-and-don't tips. In my word:

- treat blogs as code repository and long-term memory
- take it easy (e.g. _no spell-check_)

I once read a blog [_Do things, tell people._][do-things] on [hackernews][do-things-hn]. The idea is so simple that you may even ignore the content. There are a few posts on the similar topics but I cannot find them right now (but so what?)
